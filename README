garmini - download tracklogs from Garmin GPSs
Copyright (C) 2007 Tom Payne



INTRODUCTION

garmini is a simple program for downloading tracklogs from Garmin GPSs.  Its
goal is to be simple, functional and portable with no external dependencies.


QUICK START

Type "make" to build the software and "make install" (as root) to install it.

To download all the tracks from your GPS into the current directory, run:
	$ garmini
If this doesn't work then check the "TROUBLESHOOTING" section below.

By default, garmini assumes that your GPS is attached to /dev/ttyS0.  You can
specify a different device using the -d option, for example:
	$ garmini -d /dev/ttyUSB0
Garmini GPSs often appear as /dev/ttyUSB0.  To avoid typing this every time
you can set the GARMINI_DEVICE environment variable to point to the device.
For example (in bash):
	$ export GARMINI_DEVICE=/dev/ttyUSB0

For a full list of available commands and options, run:
	$ garmini -h
